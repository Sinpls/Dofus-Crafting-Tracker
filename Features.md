### Next Steps
1. Remove the window size and position retain feature in main.ts. It's not really working.
2. The flag for color coding ingredients is the cost value is from a previous session is not working properly. Every item will stay flagged. I think you are forcing the flag to be false somewhere
3. The paginitation setting I select in the tracker should persist when swapping tabs.
4. The sold and unsold filters are now wrong. Sold should filter rows that have their quantity sold equal to quantity and unsold should filter rows that do not have their quantity sold and quantity equal
5. The loading performance is really slow. Can we improve it?
